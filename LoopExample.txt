              if you want to see the reactive result just in time in the console log of the browser, 
              you will need to trigger a watchEffect hook because vue reactivity is differnt 
              you will not able to see the reactivity because what you conosle.loginig in the setup script is the 
              and the actual value in the template is different because vue automatically sets an a proxy for that ... 

              import { watch } from 'vue'

              // Watch for changes and log them
              watch(isMobile, (newValue) => {
              console.log('isMobile changed:', newValue)
})
